# Dynamic Landing Page with js(ES6)
This Landing-Page project is about manipulating the Dom. in this project i built a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigation menu based on the sections of the page, to do this i used js(ES6) to append dynamically data to the Dom and to link the navigation items to the sections. I also hid the fixed navigation bar while not scrolling, added a scroll to the top button on the page that's only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page, and created a responsive layout to use across all devices, such as modern desktops, tablets, and phone browsers.
